	- trivial bugfix in memory allocation
	- added loging into error.log

	Released version 1.0.1

	Bugfix: localized file names and paths are now fully supported.

	This is tested only in my Czech localization of Windows 7.

	Is it works in other codepages? For example in the Japanese localization of Windows? 

	PLEASE anybody: can you send me any report about this? 
	To discusions on the SF, or to my email hucik@ordoz.com
