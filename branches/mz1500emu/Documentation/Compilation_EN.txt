========================

	LINUX - target binary is compiled for Linux
	WINDOWS - target binary is compiled for Windows

	W32NAT - program is compiled native in Windows (only for WIN32 targets)
		 this directive is activation bypass for function vasprintf() - is missing here


Compilation
===========

To change configuration of this project will serve the best use Netbeans IDE.

For compilation you need:

	- mingw32 ( is need only for WIN32 target )
	- Development libraries SDL2 , ( mingw for WIN32 ! ) https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
	- GTK3 development libraries
	- libsoup-2.4
	- pkg-config





The Makefile supports several configurations:

	Release-Win32 (is default)
	Release-Win64
	Debug-Linux 
	Release-Linux 
	Debug-Win32-Native
	Release-Win32-Native


For cross compilation to WIN32 just write 'make' or 'make CONF=Release-Win32'.

For compilation to LINUX write 'make CONF=Release-Linux'.

The compilled file will be saved into ./dist/ subdirectory.

Into work directory with mz800emu must be copied ./ui_resources directory with all stored files.
