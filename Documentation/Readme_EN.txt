

If you do not want use the MZ800.BAT for the program starting (For example,
because BAT can not be placed to the main toolbar in Windows 7):

Copy files from ./runtime/gtk3 and ./runtime/sdl2 into directory with
MZ800EMU.EXE. Now may be possible use directly the EXE file for program
starting.


Styles
======

You can change the menu colors, fonts and styles by editing .css and .glade
files in ./ui_resources directory.

Keybord maping
==============

Most keys are located in the same positions as the MZ800 - like in the
emulator from Zdenek Adler.
