	Released version 1.0.4

	In this released emulator version is integrated a huge amount of bugfixes,
	improvements, features and new bugs, which I gradually collected over the last 
	two years.
	Thanks to some improvements was the emulation be significantly accelerated and  
	this achieved performance was instantly used for the new features, which this 
	slows down a bit :)
	Some peripherals have revealed new secrets and all of that has been integrated 
	into emulation.

	Just in the short:
	
	- virtual CMT now supports a multiple file formats (MZF, MZT, TAP, WAV) and allows 
	  the save into WAV

	- added a virtual keyboard and creation tools for DSK and QD images

	- added a simple simulation of the "Unicard" and IDE8 (supported by NIPOPS cp/m)

	- implemented both types of MemExt (supported by MZIX - Unix)

	- many many improvements in the debugger..., added new memory browser / editor, 
	  memory dissassembler, etc...

	- better synchronisation in the Linux, some changes about ROMs, and lots of other 
	  little things in the different places

	- added online check for new versions
	  Emulator sometimes at the startup checks the my web site and if they discover 
	  a new version of the emulator, then show the information window - this feature 
	  can be turned off and version checks can be performed manually.

	If you want to ask about some emulator features or peripherals of the MZ-800, 
	do not hesitate and ask me on the SourceForge, or by email.

	Released version 1.0.1


	Bugfix:
		- trivial bugfix in memory allocation

        This is tested only in my Czech localization of Windows 7.

        Does it work in other codepages? For example in the Japanese localization of Windows?
