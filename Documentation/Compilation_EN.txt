Preprocessor directives:
========================

	LINUX - target binary is compiled for Linux
	WIN32 - target binary is compiled for Windows

	W32NAT - program is compiled native in Windows (only for WIN32 targets)
		 this directive is activation bypass for function vasprintf() - is missing here


	MZ800_DEBUGGER - if is set, the program will be compilled with

Compilation
===========

To change configuration of this project will serve the best use Netbeans IDE.

For compilation you need:

	- mingw32 ( is need only for WIN32 target )
	- Development libraries SDL2 , ( mingw for WIN32 ! ) https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
	- GTK3 development libraries
	- pkg-config





The Makefile supports several configurations:

	Release-Win32 (is default)
	Debug-Linux 
	Release-Linux 
	Debug-Win32-Native
	Release-Win32-Native


For cross compilation to WIN32 just write 'make'.

For compilation to LINUX write 'make CONF=Release-Linux'.
